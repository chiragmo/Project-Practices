Agenda of the program:

Java does not natively provide graph implemenation. The following is an effort to craete a package for the same. The program can be used for unweighted directed graphs unweighted undirected graphs. This can be set by a boolean in the main method.

The below methods are available from the main method.
create a vertex: addVertex(stringLabel)
delete a vetex: removeVertex(stringLabel)
create an edge: createEdge(stringLabelOne, stringLabelTwo)
delete an edge: removeEdge(stringLabelOne, stringLabelTwo)

Note: The class.Graph overrides hascode() and equals() with a contract with stringLabel. Hence duplicate Nodes with same stringLabel will be treated
as equal.
